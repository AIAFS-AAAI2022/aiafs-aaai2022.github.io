Stefano Ermon is an Associate Professor of Computer Science in the CS Department at Stanford University, where he is affiliated with the Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, and a fellow of the Woods Institute for the Environment. His research goal is to enable innovative solutions to problems of broad societal relevance through advances in probabilistic modeling, learning and inference. I develop new foundational methods motivated by concrete real-world applications, focusing on a new area that bridges computer science with other disciplines to address core questions in sustainability, including poverty mitigation, food security, and renewable energy. He has won several awards, including four Best Paper Awards (AAAI, UAI and CP), a NSF Career Award, an ONR Young Investigator Award, a Sony Faculty Innovation Award, an AWS Machine Learning Award, and a McMullen Fellowship. Stefano earned his Bachelorâ€™s and Master degree in Electrical and Electronics Engineering at University of Padova in 2006 and 2008, respectively. He earned his Ph.D. in Computer Science at Cornell University in 2015.
